# What is Pentis

Pentis is a 3D Tetris experience. Similar to Tetris effect, you can play Tetris in virtual reality however Pentis allows you to actually utilise all 3 dimensions.

Similar to how Tetris uses Tetriminoes, Pentis uses Polycubes which in turn means that the blocks used are also different. There are 23 Polycubes in total (compared to the more well known 7 tetriminoes used in Tetris).

Currently I am using Pentiminoes to help with debugging as it is easier to work with 2 dimensions before moving on and working with 3.

***Pentis has no Affiliation with Tetris or Tetris Holding LLC.***
